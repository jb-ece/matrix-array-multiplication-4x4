# matrix-array-multiplication-4x4

Hi everyone, this is my version of a 4x4 systollic array using matrix multiplication. The .xpr file will be labeled under the name "Vivado File". Specific values and notes that I used will be under "Variables & More". Screenshots of my code and the actual array will be labeled "Results". I have made a category labeled "user files" that will display the top and simulation file. My design source will be in the .xpr file. This is open to all users.

 16 process units shapes in a 4 x 4 fashion.
